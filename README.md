# AQI-ML-Detector
This project leverages machine learning to analyze air quality data and predict pollution levels. It processes real-time or historical environmental data to determine AQI (Air Quality Index) and classify air pollution levels. The model is trained on various air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, and SO₂ to provide accurate air quality insights.
